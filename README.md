# documentation

An old project integrating a Pd granular & wavetable synthesis generative algorithm with an Arduino controller. The arduino is attached to a custom-built aluminum chassis holding a bunch of sensors (distance, button matrix, accelerometer/magno/gyro, joystick, maybe one more...). The sensor data is fed into Pd and used to control the patch. I made 2 presets for specific movements using the accelerometer.
